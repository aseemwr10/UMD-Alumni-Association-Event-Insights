# UMD Alumni Association Event Insights
Course project to analyze UMD Alumni Events to improve future events
University of Maryland Alumni Association
Longitudinal Impact Report

Background Information:
At the University of Maryland Alumni Association we are the heart of the university, inspiring lifelong connections with a global network of Maryland alumni. In an effort to achieve this vision, we connect, cultivate and channel the power of alumni to enrich themselves and advance the university through membership, event engagement, and volunteerism. We have the unique opportunity to assist Terps in staying connected with each other and the university long after their time spent in College Park.

We strive to make data-driven decisions to continuously improve our programs and events for students, alumni, faculty, and staff. Through our extensive coding system, alumni participation is recorded in our database by a three-part, alphanumeric activity code. These activity codes indicate the event type, sponsor, region, location, purpose and audience. This coding system has allowed the association to evaluate the return on investment for individual events, but we now want to analyze the aggregate data to draw conclusions that will inform future strategies.

Data Project Goals:
The Alumni Association would like help in identifying the variables that are correlated to our desired outcomes of higher event attendance of first time attendees and major gift prospect attendees. By understanding these correlations, we hope to optimize both new and existing events in order to improve our strategy to engage alumni in these two groups. Ultimately, we need assistance in understanding what types of events attract the largest number of first time attendees and major gift prospects so that we can use this information in planning future events.

The data set provided is from 07/01/2013-11/30/2019 and contains 7 subsets of data, arranged by fiscal year (July 1-June 30). The data set outlines each program or event hosted by the Alumni Association and provides general information on the event as well as the event registrants.

Research Questions:
Based on the variables provided in the dataset, how can we get more first time attendees and major gift prospects to attend our events?

Data Dictionary:

Activity code - A 5-digit code used to track alumni event attendance.

Location code - A 4-digit code used in concert with the activity code to denote the region and location an event takes place.

Group code - A 3-digit code used in concert with the activity code to denote the event’s intended purpose (e.g. social, service) and audience (e.g. Greek Terps, recent graduates).
